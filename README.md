## Introducing RGH Optimizer:

This is a windows optimizer by RGH, and this is my first project using python.

When using it you will get 3 choices/stages:

1. Fix, to fix any corrupted Windows files and to scan for viruses.

2. Debloat, to remove all the bloatware in Windows 11 or 10.

3. Optimize, to apply registery tweaks and to optimize Windows's settings.

You can review the code and suggest new features or report a bug, to make the optimizer better, follow me and send a feedback.

If you want to republish the optimizer you need to ask me before doing that,...
